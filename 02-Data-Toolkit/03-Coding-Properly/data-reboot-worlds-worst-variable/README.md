# Reboot Challenges

The goal of this reboot is to give you the opportunity to go over some of the core ideas from the first two modules.

These challenges will practice your skills in:

1. Working with tricky variables
2. Writing functions
3. NumPy Basics
4. Pandas Practice
5. APIs - Optional
6. Scraping - Optional

Make sure to start with the exercises you are least comfortable with! This reboot is for you to improve your weakest skills not your strongest! ðŸ’ª

# World's Worst Variable

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will be handling a terribly structured variable with multiple datatypes inside.

Along the way, you will:

- Perform a basic investigation of the variable and its structure
- Create, read, update, and delete values inside of the variable
- Use for loops to aggregate information stored inside the variable

## Let's go

To start the exercise, open `worlds_worst_variable.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.

ðŸš€ Your turn!
